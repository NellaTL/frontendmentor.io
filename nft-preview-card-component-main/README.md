## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

After focusing heavily on studying Javascript for the past few weeks this project has been a great reintroduction to using both HTML and CSS, more specifically Flexbox. 

The project allowed me to gain a better understanding of implementing hover states using the 'Position' property along with introducing transitions for better looking results. 

### Continued development

Although only briefly touching on them in this project, 'Media Queries' are something I need to spend more time on to fully understand and look to implement a mobile-first design process.  

### Useful resources

- [w3 schools CSS Image overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me understand the logic behind adding the overlay on hover.
