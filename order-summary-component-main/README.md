## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties 
- Flexbox
- BEM methodology 

### What I learned

After feedback on my previous challenge suggested I look into adopting the BEM methodology for CSS classes I spent some time looking into how I could incorporate it into my routine workflow. After my first time using it I can definitely see the benefits, especially for larger scale projects. 

### Continued development

Moving into future projects I'm going to continue to use BEM and look to reduce the amount of unnecessary code.

### Useful resources
